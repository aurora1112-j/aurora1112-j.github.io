## Introduction: Lukacs and Hegel in a modal-philosophical horizon

Recent international scholarship on Lukacs has undergone a significant paradigm shift. For a long time, discussions centered on reification, totality, and the subject-object dialectic, which indeed form the core of his early Marxist philosophy. Yet a new generation of scholars (Rametta, Thompson, Miller, Ninos, and others) has turned to a previously neglected theoretical field: Lukacs' critical transformation of Hegel's modal philosophy. This turn reveals a distinctive understanding of the dialectical relations among possibility, actuality, and necessity.

In Hegel's *Science of Logic*, modal categories are granted ontological status as the inner forms through which actuality unfolds. These include possibility (Moeglichkeit), actuality (Wirklichkeit), necessity (Notwendigkeit), and contingency (Zufaelligkeit). This paper argues that in *History and Class Consciousness* Lukacs fundamentally transforms Hegel's modal philosophy by reversing the hierarchy and placing possibility rather than necessity at the center of historical development. This transformation has two aspects. Ontologically, Lukacs converts Weber's concept of objective possibility from an epistemological tool into a modal category of social being. Practically, he inherits and critiques the practical turn in German classical philosophy, especially Fichte, to clarify the mechanism by which possibility becomes actuality. This reconstruction provides a distinctive framework for class consciousness, historical agency, and revolutionary change, and later receives systematic development in *The Ontology of Social Being* through the concept of teleological positing.

The argument unfolds in three parts. Part I analyzes the "Actuality" chapter of Hegel's *Logic*, revealing the core structure of his modal dialectic and its retrospective temporal stance. Part II examines how Lukacs converts Weber's objective possibility from a counterfactual methodological tool into an ontological component of social being, and how the distinction between formal and real possibility exposes the antinomic structure of bourgeois thought. Part III explores the practical mediation of the transition from possibility to actuality, including Fichte's legacy, contemplation as a form of reified subjectivity, and teleological positing as the mechanism of actualization, while arguing for continuity between *History and Class Consciousness* and *The Ontology of Social Being*.

## Part I. Actuality and necessity in Hegel's philosophy

To understand Lukacs' transformation of Hegelian modality, we must first examine Hegel's own modal theory in the *Science of Logic*. Hegel's reconstruction of Kant's table of categories is especially striking in his treatment of modality. In the *Critique of Pure Reason*, Kant places modality (possibility, existence, necessity) after relation, as the final group of categories. Modality does not add determinate content to objects; it only expresses the relation between judgment and the faculty of understanding. In Hegel's *Logic*, this order is reversed: modal categories precede relation, and their discussion overlaps with the concept of actuality itself, so much so that in the Doctrine of Essence, the third section is "Actuality," and the second chapter bears the same title.

This structure reflects a Hegelian principle: the whole is present in each part, and each part mirrors the whole. As a result, modality is not a peripheral add-on but the logical core of Hegel's concept of actuality.

### 1.1 The dialectical development of formal possibility, contingency, and real possibility

Hegel's modal dialectic begins with formal possibility: a thing is possible insofar as it is not self-contradictory. "Everything that is non-contradictory is possible; therefore the kingdom of possibility is a boundless manifold." Yet Hegel immediately exposes the emptiness of this determination. A claim that "everything is possible" affirms nothing. It is as vacuous as a purely formal identity.

Formal possibility interpenetrates with formal actuality, and their immediate unity is contingency. "The contingent is an actual thing, but only determined as possible, and its other or opposite is likewise possible." Contingency thus expresses a double determination: the existent is actual, yet it could be otherwise. Contingency is therefore both the completion of the formal stage and the transition to a higher one.

The sublation of contingency leads to real possibility. Real possibility is no longer abstract non-contradiction but a determination tied to a manifold of concrete conditions. Something is really possible when it has the conditions for its realization. Hegel's key insight is that once the totality of conditions is given, the state of affairs is no longer merely possible but actual. The full unfolding of real possibility therefore becomes actuality itself, and possibility as an independent category is aufgehoben. This is the emergence of relative, or real, necessity.

### 1.2 Actuality as absolute necessity

Real necessity is not yet the end of the modal dialectic. Hegel argues that real necessity is a determinate necessity; formal necessity lacks content. The determination of necessity includes its negation, contingency. Thus real necessity remains a limited actuality and is therefore itself contingent. This internal insufficiency drives the dialectic forward.

In absolute necessity, necessity is not externally imposed on contingent beings but becomes the speculative identity of contingency, possibility, and actuality. When the totality of conditions is given, what was possible is now actual; the actuality produced by such completeness is necessity itself. The contingent and the necessary thus reach a speculative unity: what exists is contingent (it could be otherwise) yet also necessary (given the conditions, it cannot be otherwise).

Yet this necessity appears blind. Absolute necessity, as the unity of contingency and necessity, manifests as the brute force of fate. The speculative unity that should express rationality now appears as irrational. Hence the dialectic must pass beyond the modal categories toward relations (substance), which then points further toward the transition from blind necessity to speculative knowledge mediated by the concept.

### 1.3 The retrospective temporal structure of Hegelian modality

Hegel's modal theory subordinates possibility: possibility is sublated into actuality, and actuality is grasped as absolute necessity, the unity of necessity and contingency. Possibility, as an open orientation toward the future, does not retain independent standing. As Rametta notes, Hegel effectively devalues possibility and concentrates on the dialectical knot between necessity and contingency. This is not an oversight but an internal requirement of the system: philosophy concerns what is real, not what is merely possible; its task is to grasp the rational structure of actuality, not the potential of what does not yet exist.

Hegel's temporal orientation is therefore retrospective. In the famous preface to the *Philosophy of Right*, Hegel insists that philosophy appears only after reality has completed its process of formation. It does not predict the future; it understands what has already been completed. The object of philosophy is thus an already-formed reality, and philosophical labor is to grasp that reality as necessary. This retrospection grants priority to the past and re-establishes a split between the contemplative subject and the contemplated object. The observer faces a completed world that cannot be intervened in, only understood. This contemplative stance will become, for Lukacs, the epistemological prototype of reification.

## Part II. Objective possibility: from epistemological tool to ontological category

In *History and Class Consciousness*, objective possibility is a pivotal but long-neglected category. Compared with reification or totality, it has received limited attention. Yet recent scholarship shows that it is a hinge for Lukacs' theory of class consciousness, historical action, and revolution.

### 2.1 Weber's methodological use of objective possibility

Lukacs adopts "objective possibility" from Max Weber's methodological writings. Weber drew the idea from J. S. Mill's probability theory, Johannes von Kries, and legal reasoning, and used it to address causal attribution in history and society. Objective possibility serves a counterfactual strategy: by asking "If X had happened, what would follow?" the historian can identify which conditions were decisive for actual outcomes.

This concept is tied to many methodological themes in the social sciences, including sufficient causation, ideal types, and the attribution of group mentalities. Lukacs' vocabulary reflects this training. Yet Weber's framework is rooted in neo-Kantianism: objective possibility remains an epistemological tool for retrospective explanation, not an ontological claim about reality itself.

### 2.2 Lukacs' dual transformation: from epistemology to ontology, from past to future

Lukacs' key move is to elevate objective possibility from a counterfactual historiographical category to a modal element of social being. It no longer names hypothetical pasts, but current tensions that are real even if not yet actual, and that can be realized in collective action.

In "Class Consciousness" he writes that relating consciousness to the social totality yields the category of objective possibility: one can recognize the thoughts and feelings people could have in a given situation, and the thoughts and feelings that correspond to objective conditions. Here Lukacs breaks the neo-Kantian split between fact and value, treating possibility as objectively embedded in social being, akin to Hegel's real possibility rather than a formal logical possibility.

He also reconstructs actuality itself. "Now - to use Hegel's expression - becoming appears as the truth of being; process appears as the truth of things." Tendencies of historical development are more real than empirical facts. Reality is a dynamic totality of processes and trends, not a static given. Possibility thus ceases to be a mere counterfactual and becomes a structural element of the historical process.

In the modal sense, the concept of tendency becomes central to reality. In the early Hungarian version of "What Is Orthodox Marxism?" Lukacs explicitly introduces possibility: the revolutionary moment is a dialectical conversion that is present as possibility in every moment, yet cannot be calculated like a comet. It turns into actuality only when the workers' movement grasps the unity of theory and practice, movement and final goal.

He also explains the transition from formal to real possibility: historical materialism is a formal, objective possibility because economic development creates the proletariat; it becomes an actual possibility only in the proletariat's development. The path is from "utopia" to knowledge of reality, from "a class opposed to capitalism" to "a class for itself." Possibility is thus from the outset oriented toward the future and praxis, not merely toward retrospective explanation. Revolution is a practical category as much as an ontological one: it diagnoses objective tendencies and calls for collective action to actualize them.

These two transformations - epistemology to ontology, past to future - are internally unified. Objective possibility becomes an ontological category because the historical subject of action, the proletariat, is the bearer and realizor of that possibility. In this doctrine, thought acquires an interventive, practical function: it treats tendencies as more real than mere empirical facts.

### 2.3 Formal and real possibility: the antinomies of bourgeois thought

In "The Antinomies of Bourgeois Thought," Lukacs further develops the internal differentiation of possibility. Using Hegel's distinction between formal and real possibility, he translates objective possibility into a critique of the structural limits of bourgeois cognition. In the later revision of "What Is Orthodox Marxism?" he distinguishes two possibilities of historical materialist knowledge: the formal possibility arising from the economic development that creates the proletariat, and the real possibility realized in the proletariat's development as a class.

For Lukacs, formal possibility is not merely a logical operation of the subject. It is a material, historical form of objectivity in capitalist development. Real possibility is another form of objectivity, expressing a deeper practical relation between subject and totality. Different modalities of possibility therefore correspond to different practical relations between historical subjects and the social whole. As Lukacs writes, every substantial change in knowledge manifests as a change in relation to the whole, and thus as a change in the form of objectivity itself.

This distinction connects directly to reification. Reified consciousness freezes historically produced social relations into eternal facts and laws, blocking the cognition of capitalist society as a transformable historical totality. Bourgeois thought can acknowledge formal logical possibility in the abstract, but its class position binds it to immediacy and prevents it from grasping real possibility rooted in social contradictions. It cannot translate abstract logical possibility into concrete historical force.

### 2.4 Objective possibility and objective impossibility: the form of class consciousness

If real possibility marks the proletariat's objective horizon of knowledge and practice, the abstract kingdom of formal possibility marks the bourgeoisie's objective limit. Lukacs' distinctive contribution is to examine class consciousness through the interaction of possibility and actuality, and to analyze the mutual constitution of objective possibility and objective impossibility. The bourgeoisie is objectively unable to grasp capitalist society as a totality; this impossibility indicts the structural limits of bourgeois ideology.

In "Class Consciousness," Lukacs treats class consciousness as an objective possibility attributable to a class standpoint. But its realization is asymmetrical across classes. Consciousness appears as what is "understandable and must be understood" and thus as "correct" consciousness; yet it also appears as consciousness that does not correspond to social development and thus as "false" consciousness. For the bourgeoisie, class position itself is a structural obstacle to total knowledge. Reification binds it to immediacy; the possibility of grasping capitalism as a historical totality is objectively impossible for the bourgeoisie.

By contrast, the proletariat is objectively capable of breaking through the fog of reification, though this is not inevitable. As the bearer of commodified labor power, the proletariat is both victim and potential witness of reification's falsity. Its existence is a critique of reification, enabling it to see from the core. Yet because reification persists and consciousness is dialectically split, the transition from possibility to actuality requires conscious effort. Lukacs calls this not a psychological state but an objective striving: the pursuit of what is correct does not automatically succeed; only through heightened consciousness, self-critical action, and practical effort can it become historically effective knowledge.

Objective possibility and objective striving thus belong together. They denote the proletariat's recognition of its position within the social whole and its capacity to realize revolutionary self-abolition.

### 2.5 Inverting the modal hierarchy: the priority of possibility over necessity

Here the distance between Lukacs and Hegel becomes clear. Hegel's modal dialectic culminates in actuality as absolute necessity, the unity of contingency and necessity. Existence finds its ultimate ground through interpenetration with possibility; in those terms, necessity names the unity of actuality with contingency. The movement of reality is thus ruled by absolute necessity.

Lukacs insists instead on the relation between modal possibility and historical creation. By interrupting the speculative transition from actuality to the concept, he brings the problem back to political practice, which is the true meaning of theory. In his terms, one must move from the practice of theory to the theory of practice.

The inversion of the modal hierarchy has deep theoretical and political consequences. History is not locked into a pre-given track of necessity; it remains open to multiple possibilities. Subjectivity, especially class consciousness, gains a decisive role. Objective possibilities are realized only through conscious collective action and the unity of theory and practice. As Miller summarizes, Lukacs borrows objective possibility from Weber and fuses it with Marxist and Hegelian vocabularies, creating a modal social ontology in which class consciousness, historical action, and revolution can be theorized.

## Part III. The practical mediation of possibility

Having established the ontological status of objective possibility and its critical relation to Hegel's modality, we must ask: how does possibility become actuality? What mediations and conditions make this transition possible? Lukacs' answer constitutes the practical-philosophical dimension of his modal theory, whose sources trace back to German classical philosophy, especially the practical turn inaugurated by Fichte.

### 3.1 Fichte's legacy: the practical turn in the problem of subject-object unity

Lukacs' analysis of German classical philosophy in *History and Class Consciousness* centers on how to overcome the subject-object dualism left by Kant. In "The Antinomies of Bourgeois Thought," he retraces the path from Kant through Fichte and Schelling to Hegel. For this paper, Fichte's key contribution is his explicit claim that the hope for subject-object unity lies in practice rather than theory.

Kant's theoretical philosophy faces a fundamental dilemma: the a priori forms of understanding provide the conditions for possible experience, yet the thing-in-itself remains an unknowable boundary between subject and absolute reality. Fichte radicalizes Kant by asking how the subject can both posit itself and regard itself as the author of the norms it follows. From the *Foundations of the Entire Science of Knowledge* to the *System of Ethics* and *The Vocation of Man*, Fichte moves from a purely subjective idealism toward a position that includes the objective world. Through the self's ongoing positing of itself in the world and its oscillation between subject and object, Fichte argues that the aim of theoretical reason is to ground the legitimacy of moral action and to provide norms for transforming the objective world. The core postulate of theoretical reason is that an object exists outside the self; this is provable only as a condition for moral action, as the condition for striving to change and improve the world. The concept of purpose becomes decisive: the subject can set goals and realize them in the objective world. This is the insight Lukacs later develops in the concept of teleological positing.

Hegel, however, saw the limits of Fichte's position. Fichte did not overcome Kantian dualism but reintroduced it in a new form. The Fichtean subject is active, substantial, and teleological; the Fichtean object is inert, phenomenal, and mechanical. The unity of subject and object remains an infinite approximation that can never be fully realized in empirical reality. Fichte's philosophy is crucial for Lukacs not only because it emphasizes practice but because it reveals the structural reasons why bourgeois philosophy cannot overcome the split between subject and object. Fichte's practical subject is an isolated individual self; its practice is an ethical act, while the social-historical whole remains an external given. For Lukacs, the way out is to shift from individual ethical action to social-historical practice.

### 3.2 Contemplation as the subjective form of reification

Before examining Lukacs' critical inheritance of Fichte, we must consider his diagnosis of contemplation. Contemplative attitude constitutes the subjective obstacle that prevents possibility from becoming actuality. For Lukacs, the root of German classical philosophy's impasse lies in the reified structure of bourgeois society, and contemplation is that structure's subjective expression.

In "Reification and the Consciousness of the Proletariat," Lukacs analyzes how the universalization of the commodity form transforms subjectivity. As capitalism develops, relations between things appear as relations between persons, and persons themselves are subsumed under the logic of commodity and calculability. The epistemological consequence is a contemplative relation between subject and object: the subject faces a pre-given world that runs according to its own laws and can only be contemplated, not practically transformed. Theory and practice are split; theory becomes recognition of what exists, and practice becomes adaptive action within fixed structures. This contemplative stance echoes the retrospective temporal structure of Hegelian modality: absolute knowledge reconstructs the meaning of history after the fact but cannot foresee revolutionary possibility.

The crucial insight is that contemplation is historically produced and therefore historically surmountable. Reification is not an eternal structure of human existence but a product of a specific historical form, capitalism. Overcoming contemplation is therefore not only an epistemological task but a practical-political one. It requires a form of action that breaks reified appearances and reconstructs an active relation between subject and object.

### 3.3 Overcoming contemplation: from individual ethical action to socio-historical practice

Lukacs' critical inheritance of Fichte culminates here. Fichte correctly recognizes that the path beyond dualism lies in practice rather than theory, but he treats action as an individual ethical effort and thus remains trapped between the ought and the is, between infinite approximation and non-realization. Lukacs' transformation is to shift the practice that overcomes contemplation from individual ethical action to social-historical practice.

This shift has two implications. First, the subject of practice is not the isolated individual but a historically determined collective - under capitalism, the proletariat. The proletariat's epistemological privilege does not come from an innate correct consciousness, but from its social existence as the extreme product of commodification, which contains the possibility of breaking reified appearance from within. Its self-knowledge is knowledge of the social totality; its emancipatory action is the sublation of reification itself.

Second, the object of practice is no longer an external nature or external society but the historical totality that the subject itself participates in producing. Lukacs' concept of totality sublates the duality between subject and object, knower and known, actor and acted-upon through social-historical mediation. In the view of totality, the world is not a given external object but a product of human practice, and therefore subject to transformation.

This shift transfers the problem of subject-object unity from individual epistemology to social ontology. The proletariat as the unity of historical subject and object does not mean every worker automatically grasps the totality; it means the proletariat's class position makes such knowledge objectively possible. This is the core meaning of objective possibility.

### 3.4 Teleological positing as the mechanism of actualization

A further question follows: if the object of practice is the historical totality, how is such practice possible? The totality is not a ready-made object that any single action can directly grasp; it pervades all social relations. If the realization of objective possibility depends on conscious collective action, what is the internal structure of such action? Lukacs answers in *The Ontology of Social Being* through the concept of teleological positing.

Teleological positing is a central but long-neglected concept in Lukacs. It is essential for understanding *The Ontology of Social Being*, and it also re-reads the possibility theory of *History and Class Consciousness*. In brief, teleological positing is a special type of causality: the result (purpose) is posited in consciousness before the process, and then realized by selecting and using causal chains. In teleological positing, what does not yet exist is grasped as a possibility and set as the aim of action, then brought into being through practice. Lukacs stresses that teleological positing is genuine production: it breaks the closed chain of pure causal necessity by introducing something new into existence.

Lukacs distinguishes two types of teleological positing. The first targets nature directly, aiming to transform materials to satisfy human needs. In *The Ontology of Social Being*, he defines labor as a teleological positing realized within material being - a mental plan that achieves material realization, projecting a desired goal into objective reality and introducing a qualitatively new material change. Here the purpose exists in consciousness prior to action; it is realized through the manipulation and reorganization of materials; and it yields a new objectivity. Lukacs repeatedly cites Marx's example of building a house: the house, like stone and wood, is a material being, yet the teleological positing of house-building creates a new objectivity distinct from the raw materials.

The second type targets the consciousness of others and seeks to influence and coordinate their activity. When the goal is no longer nature but the teleological positing of others, labor acquires a second-order teleological character. This second-order form grounds complex social practices such as political organization and revolutionary action. It is crucial for understanding class consciousness in *History and Class Consciousness*: proletarian class consciousness is not merely a passive reflection of social structure but a second-order teleological positing that aims at the consciousness of the masses, coordinating collective action. As Lukacs argues in "Methodology of the Problem of Organization," the party's function is to raise class unity to the highest possible level.

Teleological positing is internally linked to the category of possibility. A purpose is itself a possibility, a state of affairs that does not yet exist but is believed to be possible. When a subject posits a purpose, it grasps an objective possibility and sets it as the orientation of action. Yet possibility is inert; it does not become actual on its own. The key insight is that possibility requires a subject capable of positing ends and acting on them as a mediation between possibility and actuality. Here the deepest difference between Lukacs and Hegel becomes clear. In Hegel's modal dialectic, possibility becomes actuality through a logical speculative process: once the totality of conditions is given, possibility automatically becomes reality. This logic presupposes a contemplative standpoint in which the knower discovers an already existing necessity. Lukacs rejects this: the transition from possibility to actuality is not automatic. It requires teleological positing, and therefore practice is irreducible. Practice is not an application of knowledge; it is the ontological mechanism by which being itself moves from possibility to actuality.

### 3.5 From the practice of theory to the theory of practice

Teleological positing is not a purely subjective desire. The setting of purpose must rest on a correct grasp of objective conditions, otherwise it collapses into empty utopianism. This reveals the unity of modal theory and practical philosophy. Objective possibility analyzes what is realizable; teleological positing explains how the realizable is realized. Together they form the core of Lukacs' historical materialism. Here we can fully grasp the modal implication Rametta describes: the shift from the practice of theory to the theory of practice, which concerns the mode of being of theory itself and its internal relation to practice.

Although Lukacs never states this explicitly, he continues themes shared with both Hegel and Fichte. The traditional model treats theory as contemplation of what exists and practice as the application of such knowledge to external reality. This model presupposes a contemplative epistemology and is itself a product of reification. Lukacs' transformation is to re-conceive theory as an internal moment of practice, as the consciousness that sets purposes and orients action. Truth is not mere correspondence with a pre-given reality; it is the effective mediation of possibility into actuality. Theory, in its mode of being, is already practical.

The modal consequence is decisive: if theory is practical, it cannot only grasp necessity; it must also grasp possibility. It must recognize objective possibilities embedded in the present and provide orientation for action. Revolutionary possibility cannot be calculated with astronomical precision; it becomes actual only when the workers' movement realizes that theory and practice, movement and final goal, are a unity. Lukacs' modal theory, practical philosophy, and teleology thus form an internal unity: possibility as an ontological category must be grasped by theory, posited as purpose by consciousness, and realized through practice. The movement from recognizing possibility to positing ends to executing action is the meaning of the practice of theory.

### 3.6 Continuity from *History and Class Consciousness* to *The Ontology of Social Being*

Finally, we must ask whether there is continuity in Lukacs' possibility theory from *History and Class Consciousness* to *The Ontology of Social Being*. This question has long been contested: the Budapest School emphasized rupture, and Lukacs' self-critique in the 1967 preface seems to support that view; recent work increasingly argues for continuity.

Understanding the relation between the two works requires attention to different levels of the concept of labor. In *History and Class Consciousness*, labor appears in the commodity form as wage labor and alienated labor - reified and alienated practice. In *The Ontology of Social Being*, labor becomes the basic principle of subjectivity: humans create history and reproduce themselves through everyday consciousness and practice. The difference is rooted in Lukacs' shifting appropriation of Hegel. The former is more phenomenological, focused on the historical-phenomenological structure of labor in capitalist society; the latter turns toward the ontological dimension of the *Logic*. This difference does not imply a simple rupture. Despite Lukacs' later criticism of his own Hegelian formulations, his core insight that the proletariat as historical subject can transform social reality through practice is strengthened in the *Ontology*, where labor is reformulated as teleological positing.

The core of continuity lies in teleological positing. In the *Ontology*, labor is placed at the center of historical materialist ontology. The subject first imagines a goal that does not yet exist and then realizes it by using and transforming natural causality. Labor is thus a model for the transition from possibility to actuality. Lukacs explicitly rejects the Hegelian exaggeration of necessity that sacrifices the priority of reality; this allows us to see that *History and Class Consciousness* already contains the structural elements of teleological positing: revolutionary change as purpose, organization as knowledge of means, and proletarian action as the mechanism that realizes possibility. The *Ontology* systematizes these elements and turns them into a full social ontology.

Continuity does not erase differences. The revolutionary urgency of *History and Class Consciousness* is tempered in the *Ontology*, which insists on social complexity and the irreducibility of political choice. Lukacs thus emphasizes plural and open possibilities rather than a single revolutionary possibility. Miller notes a hint of this pluralism when Lukacs observes that the stratification of interests within the proletariat produces the problem of whether objective class consciousness is actually realized. In the *Ontology*, teleological positing is generalized beyond revolutionary consciousness to all human practice, providing a framework for multiple social possibilities.

## Conclusion: Open possibility and unfinished questions

This study re-reads the classical critiques of *History and Class Consciousness* from a new angle. Those critiques either focus on the violent identity of totality and the subject-centered paradigm, or denounce the essentialist presupposition of the proletariat as historical subject. Later critical theory follows a clear trajectory: reification is expanded from a specific capitalist structure to a general feature of civilization, reduced to a pathology of intersubjective communication, or reinterpreted as a deficit of cognitive-affective attitudes. In this process, reification loses its political-economic ground, and the objective possibility of transformation retreats from theoretical view. Critique no longer appeals to historical tendencies rooted in social contradictions but to formal normative presuppositions or subjective attitude adjustments. Ironically, the replacement concepts still carry a dimension of possibility, but in a de-historicized and formalized form, detached from concrete analysis of existing society.

This does not mean Lukacs is beyond criticism. Overconfidence in the revolutionary potential of the proletariat, the slide from possibility toward necessity, and the Hegelian residue of totality all point to tensions in his theory. The deeper question remains: how can critique retain its negating force without becoming groundless utopianism? And in a time when the possibility of historical transformation seems increasingly narrow, what does it mean to revisit Lukacs' theory of possibility? If critique is not only negation of the existing order but also an orientation toward a possible other - a different and better form of life - what ontological commitments are required? How possibility becomes reality remains an unavoidable question for any serious philosophy of history.
