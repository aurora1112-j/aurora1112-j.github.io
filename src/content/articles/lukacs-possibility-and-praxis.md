## Introduction: Lukacs and Hegel in a modal-philosophical horizon

Recent international scholarship on Lukacs has undergone a significant paradigm shift. For a long time, discussions centered on reification, totality, and the subject-object dialectic, which indeed form the core of his early Marxist philosophy. Yet a new generation of scholars (Rametta, Thompson, Miller, Ninos, and others) has turned to a previously neglected theoretical field: Lukacs' critical transformation of Hegel's modal philosophy. This turn reveals a distinctive understanding of the dialectical relations among possibility, actuality, and necessity.

In Hegel's *Science of Logic*, modal categories are granted ontological status as the inner forms through which actuality unfolds. These include possibility (Moeglichkeit), actuality (Wirklichkeit), necessity (Notwendigkeit), and contingency (Zufaelligkeit). This paper argues that in *History and Class Consciousness* Lukacs fundamentally transforms Hegel's modal philosophy by reversing the hierarchy and placing possibility rather than necessity at the center of historical development. This transformation has two aspects. Ontologically, Lukacs converts Weber's concept of objective possibility from an epistemological tool into a modal category of social being. Practically, he inherits and critiques the practical turn in German classical philosophy, especially Fichte, to clarify the mechanism by which possibility becomes actuality. This reconstruction provides a distinctive framework for class consciousness, historical agency, and revolutionary change, and later receives systematic development in *The Ontology of Social Being* through the concept of teleological positing.

The argument unfolds in three parts. Part I analyzes the "Actuality" chapter of Hegel's *Logic*, revealing the core structure of his modal dialectic and its retrospective temporal stance. Part II examines how Lukacs converts Weber's objective possibility from a counterfactual methodological tool into an ontological component of social being, and how the distinction between formal and real possibility exposes the antinomic structure of bourgeois thought. Part III explores the practical mediation of the transition from possibility to actuality, including Fichte's legacy, contemplation as a form of reified subjectivity, and teleological positing as the mechanism of actualization, while arguing for continuity between *History and Class Consciousness* and *The Ontology of Social Being*.

## Part I. Actuality and necessity in Hegel's philosophy

To understand Lukacs’ transformation of Hegelian modality, we must first examine Hegel’s own modal theory in the Science of Logic. Hegel’s reconstruction of Kant’s table of categories is especially striking in his treatment of modality. In the Critique of Pure Reason, Kant places modality (possibility, existence, necessity) after relation, as the final group of categories. Modality does not add determinate content to objects; it only expresses the relation between judgment and the faculty of understanding. In Hegel’s Logic, this order is reversed: modal categories precede relation, and their discussion overlaps with the concept of actuality itself, so much so that in the Doctrine of Essence, the third section is “Actuality,” and the second chapter bears the same title.

This structure reflects a Hegelian principle: the whole is present in each part, and each part mirrors the whole. As a result, modality is not a peripheral add-on but the logical core of Hegel’s concept of actuality.



### 1.1 The dialectical development of formal possibility, contingency, and real possibility



### 1.2 Actuality as absolute necessity



### 1.3 The retrospective temporal structure of Hegelian modality



## Part II. Objective possibility: from epistemological tool to ontological category

In *History and Class Consciousness*, objective possibility is a pivotal but long-neglected category. Compared with reification or totality, it has received limited attention. Yet recent scholarship shows that it is a hinge for Lukacs' theory of class consciousness, historical action, and revolution.

### 2.1 Weber's methodological use of objective possibility



### 2.2 Lukacs' dual transformation: from epistemology to ontology, from past to future





### 2.3 Formal and real possibility: the antinomies of bourgeois thought



### 2.4 Objective possibility and objective impossibility: the form of class consciousness



### 2.5 Inverting the modal hierarchy: the priority of possibility over necessity



## Part III. The practical mediation of possibility

Having established the ontological status of objective possibility and its critical relation to Hegel's modality, we must ask: how does possibility become actuality? What mediations and conditions make this transition possible? Lukacs' answer constitutes the practical-philosophical dimension of his modal theory, whose sources trace back to German classical philosophy, especially the practical turn inaugurated by Fichte.

### 3.1 Fichte's legacy: the practical turn in the problem of subject-object unity



### 3.2 Contemplation as the subjective form of reification


### 3.3 Overcoming contemplation: from individual ethical action to socio-historical practice



### 3.4 Teleological positing as the mechanism of actualization



### 3.5 From the practice of theory to the theory of practice



### 3.6 Continuity from *History and Class Consciousness* to *The Ontology of Social Being*




## Conclusion: Open possibility and unfinished questions

This study re-reads the classical critiques of *History and Class Consciousness* from a new angle. Those critiques either focus on the violent identity of totality and the subject-centered paradigm, or denounce the essentialist presupposition of the proletariat as historical subject. Later critical theory follows a clear trajectory: reification is expanded from a specific capitalist structure to a general feature of civilization, reduced to a pathology of intersubjective communication, or reinterpreted as a deficit of cognitive-affective attitudes. In this process, reification loses its political-economic ground, and the objective possibility of transformation retreats from theoretical view. Critique no longer appeals to historical tendencies rooted in social contradictions but to formal normative presuppositions or subjective attitude adjustments. Ironically, the replacement concepts still carry a dimension of possibility, but in a de-historicized and formalized form, detached from concrete analysis of existing society.

This does not mean Lukacs is beyond criticism. Overconfidence in the revolutionary potential of the proletariat, the slide from possibility toward necessity, and the Hegelian residue of totality all point to tensions in his theory. The deeper question remains: how can critique retain its negating force without becoming groundless utopianism? And in a time when the possibility of historical transformation seems increasingly narrow, what does it mean to revisit Lukacs' theory of possibility? If critique is not only negation of the existing order but also an orientation toward a possible other - a different and better form of life - what ontological commitments are required? How possibility becomes reality remains an unavoidable question for any serious philosophy of history.
