Between 2025-01-19 and 2026-01-06, this series gathers trees seen over changing light, captured on a Nikon Z 5 and an iPhone 14. Two frames retain GPS traces around 30.15-30.24, 120.07-120.16.

Trees stand as slow sentences: trunks like lines of ink, leaves a soft grammar of wind. The camera lingers on their quiet endurance, letting the canopy carry time.
