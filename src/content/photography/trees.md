Between 2025-01-19 and 2026-01-06, this series traces trees seen across shifting light, with two frames anchored around 30.15–30.24, 120.07–120.16. Branches, bark, and canopy become a quiet record of place: some trees lean into salt air, some hold their crowns tightly against winter, some unfurl in softer, inland light.

Across these different grounds, growth reads like a dialect—rings of endurance, silhouettes of patience, leaves writing their brief, green sentences before the wind turns the page.
